<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
<br>
<b>Asterism</b>
<br><br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2187450/Asterism/" target="_blank">Asterism</a> is an interactive music album set in a hand-crafted solar system. 
It is a primarily solo project that I am the designer, programmer, artist and musician of. 
The game is made in Unity and uses its Timeline tool extensively to sync events to music, as well as custom shaders to handle the variety of art styles in the game.

<b>Small games and game jams</b>
<br><br>
I enjoy taking part in game jams regularly and making small games to take breaks from my larger projects! Most of the small games I've made recently are on  <a href="https://shimmerwitch.itch.io/" target="_blank">my itch.io account.</a>
I really love working with different people and trying to come up with something cohesive in a short time frame. 
<br><br>
These games are generally made in either Unity or small tools like Bitsy and Flatpack.

<h2>3-Fold Games</h2>
<br>
I am the co-founder of <a href="http://twitter.com/3foldgames" target="_blank">3-Fold Games</a>, a micro games studio that is interested telling stories that are under-represented within games. 
I was the lead programer and co-designer on our debut game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1126600/Before_I_Forget/" target="_blank">Before I Forget</a>, a first-person narrative adventure game about a woman with early-onset dementia. 
The game's primary mechanic is exploring a house and examining objects that trigger visual and audio effects, such as colour returning to the world, voice-over lines, and music/sfx. 
I wrote a number of systems for the game to incorporate accessibility features such as text size and contrast, and audio subtitles, as well as other features like voice-over and localisation options, as well as an interactive developer commentary.
I also worked with an audio programmer to integrate the music and sfx using FMOD.

<h2>Client Work</h2>
<br>
<b>Biome Collective</b>
<br><br>
I have worked with Biome Collective on several games and digital works. 
<br><br> 
<a href="https://www.playablecity.com/projects/playable-city-sandbox-street-pixel/" target="_blank">Street Pixel</a> was a prototype created for Playable City, which involved a physical walkway of interactive paving slabs that members of the public could create music on or play simple games with.
I worked as the gameplay programmer alongside a digital maker and a hardware programmer to integrate the alternative physical controllers into the game. 
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/project-updates/exploring-virtual-food-environments/" target="_blank">City Box</a> was another prototype, 
which was created for NESTA in response to a challenge to use game technology to explore Scotlandâ€™s food environment.
The game was a small city simulator that showed the effects of different food environment policy implementations on simulated members of the public. 
On this project I worked as the lead programmer and created the simulation system as well as integrating the UI.
<br><br>
I also briefly worked on <a href="https://www.biomecollective.com/the-garden" target="_blank">Garden</a> to implement some new gameplay features into pre-exisiting code and worked a lot with scriptable objects. 
<br><br>


<b>Pretty Digital</b>
<br><br>
I was the lead programmer on <a href="https://wonzie-world.itch.io/wonzie-world" target="_blank">Wonzie World</a>, a 2D co-op action game aimed at families that looked at issues of consent and personal space through the lens of children making dens. 
During this project I implemented local and online networking, and also worked extensively with prefabs, inherited classes, and UI.
<br><br>


<b>Technology and Creativity Limited</b>
<br><br>
I worked as a gameplay programmer on <a href="https://www.tandc.games/projects/grace-hopper-bug-rescue/" target="_blank">Grace Hopper: Bug Rescue</a>, a 2D sokoban puzzle game designed for children to learn about the history of programming. 
I worked with existing code to add new gameplay functionality and tools for the level designer.
