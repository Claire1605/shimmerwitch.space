<p>
I had an idea for a tower defense game that was specifically non-violent and not themed around combat or the military. Perhaps you control the wind and rivers, moving nutrients and creatures through a woodland to help grow the plants. Perhaps you are delivering letters to a town. Recently I re-played the game Anomaly, which has a reverse tower defense setup where you control the 'waves' rather than the towers, which may work for this idea. I'm still thinking about this one and might come back to it.
