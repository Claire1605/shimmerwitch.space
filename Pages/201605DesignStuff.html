<h1 class="logo">Talk: Games for Interactive Learning</h1>
<h1 class="logo" style="font-size: 1.5em;">May 2016</h1>
<br>
<p>
This talk was at a cafe in Bristol, titled 'Games for Interactive Learning', where I talked about prototypes and art I had created previously and projects I had been involved in that combined science and personal experiences with gameplay. The description for my talk was:
<br><br>
My joint background as a freelance games artist and developer and as a science graduate has shaped the way I think about learning. I have been involved in several outreach programmes and am very intersted in the current focus on interactivity within education. There are increasing examples of interactive experiences used in museums and schools, and I feel that games are a particularly good mechanism for providing this experience.
<br>
I am currently involved in a project called the 'Virtual Natural History Museum', which aims to provide teaching resources for palaeontology in an accessible game-like environment. I am also interested in 'games for change', which aim to educate the user on global or social issues.
