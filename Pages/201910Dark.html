This is a tiny prototype I made, which I think about quite a lot and will hopefully come back to. I created this art style in Unity using Fernando Ramallo's <a href="https://fernandoramallo.itch.io/doodle-studio-95" target="_blank">Doodle Studio 95.</a>
<br>
Right now you walk down this long road, with high walls either side, always moving forwards. I've noticed that a lot of the small games I make in Unity and other tools are some form of flat game, 3D in this case. A path that you follow and take in the surroundings as you move, thinking about what you see.

For this game, I would like to experiment with music more than in my previous work. I'm inspired by games such as <a href="https://ladispute.itch.io/pilgrimage" target="_blank">Pilgrimage</a> by Joost Eggermont Jorrit de Vries, which allows you to explore the music of band La Dispute, by travelling through beautful abstract environments. Music is a large and personal part of my life, but something I have struggled with creatively over the last decade or so. When I come back to this project I would like to create a world designed around the music I write.
