<p>
My first talk was at Bristol's Girl Geek Dinners meetup. I did a joint talk with Constance Fleuriot, where she talked about her meetup Grrrl Games, and afterwards I talked about my route into games and some of the projects I had been working on at the time, such as the Virtual Natural History Museum.<br>
