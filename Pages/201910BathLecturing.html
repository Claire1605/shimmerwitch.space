In 2019 I did a short series of guest lectures for Creative Computing students at Bath Spa University. I covered topics such as Level Design, Character Design, and Prototyping Games. Within these we went through some theory, followed by putting the ideas into practice with paper prototyping and using simple tools that allowed the students to focus their ideas without distractions from more complex game engines.
