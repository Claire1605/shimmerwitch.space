In 2018 some people from the Bitsy community ran an event called <a href="https://www.babycastles.com/master-calendar/pixels-x-paper" target="_blank">Pixels x Paper</a> at Babycastles in New York City. I wrote a piece for the companion zine to the event, which you can <a href="https://pixelsxpaper.itch.io/zine" target="_blank">download here.</a>

On Bitsy<br><br>
Claire Morley<br><br>
I get pretty excited when I learn to use a new cool creative thing
and always want to share it and allow other people to experience
that excitement too. It’s amazing to see the different ways that
they might use it, and what they might gain from it. One of the first
things I wanted to do when I started using Bitsy was to tell everyone
else how amazing Bitsy is.<br><br>
Bitsy taught me some really important lessons about game design,
particularly about scope and limitations – making something
manageable and complete, whatever that meant to each project (maybe
that means it’s not complete at all). These were lessons that I’d
heard before but never really put into practice. Bitsy enforces it
through its design, and at the same time allows you to make something
that feels cohesive and hand-crafted, complete but with boundaries
stretching beyond itself.<br><br>
I loved that it was so easy to learn and to use, but at the time
there wasn’t much documentation or anything in the way of a tutorial
on how to use Bitsy, so I made one and put it online a few weeks
after I made my first Bitsy game. Talking to people online about it
after was so lovely, and was the first time I’d really got involved in
an online community for anything. The Bitsy community is one of the
best things about Bitsy – people are very friendly, supportive and
respectful, and I think a lot of that comes down to (obviously the
people being great, but also) the fact that it’s built around a tool
that’s so creative and accessible. I wanted to spread the culture of
Bitsy – Bitsy culture is sharing and creativity. <br><br>
I’ve helped run 5 Bitsy workshops so far, all at quite different
events to different audiences: game design students at a university;
children and their parents at a tech fair; one lunchtime in my office
of developers, HR staff and business analysts; A MAZE festival
in Berlin; a local women’s game developer meetup. At all of the
workshops people pick up Bitsy within minutes, and most have a
playable game within an hour. Bitsy gives people an opportunity
to express themselves in a medium they might not have experienced
creating in before, and I love being able to help open that up to as
many people as possible. But, the great thing about Bitsy is that
it’s not just a tool for people new to game development, it’s a tool
for everyone and has so much value and potential. For me, it allowed
me to focus on the core components of a game and its narrative and to
filter out a lot of the noise I normally feel when designing games.
The limitations allowed me to focus, create, and then move on to a
new area of the design, while keeping the central theme in sight.
<br><br>
My pace of making Bitsy games has slowed down in the last few months,
and sometimes I feel like I *should* be making more, but I think
that Bitsy has opened me up to thinking about game design in lots of
new ways, and has given me lots to think about when I’m developing
with other tools too. Like the games its developers make, Bitsy’s
boundaries stretch far beyond itself.
