James and I made a game for Ludum Dare for the first time in years! The theme for LD46 was "Keep it alive", so we discussed ideas for a while and eventually decided on a subject we had talked about for a previous idea - mycorrhizal networks.
Mycorrhizal relationships form between fungii and plants, and are mutually beneficial - providing carbon to the fungii and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous to trees. What's amazing about them is that the networks they form can span entire forests, and act as a chemical communication system between trees - distributing nutrients and alerting each other to dangers such as parasites.
LD46 happened to coincide with the Climate Jam on itch.io, and this seemed to fit thematically too, since deforestation and modern agriculture disrupt mycorrhizal networks, breaking communication links in forests and isolating trees from their neighbours.
<br><br>
We wanted to use this idea of communication and hidden information - logging in to a system that shares resources among a community. Which is where the anaglyph glasses come in! The red and blue lenses act as a filter for colours on a screen, and from a little experimentation we discovered that someone looking through the blue lens would find that anything Cyan on a White background appears invisible, and someone looking through the red lens would find Yellow on a White background invisible. 
We adapted a couple of pairs of anaglyph glasses to make a blue pair and a red pair, and used these to make our little prototype puzzle game. We found that due to the hidden information and co-operative goal we were discussing the puzzle and working together to solve it :)
