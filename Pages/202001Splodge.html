Splodge is a game made with clay and other things found nearby. It was made by myself, Douglas Flinders and James Wood for the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/splodge-6" target="_blank">2020 Global Game Jam</a>.
<br><br>
We were at Coatsink's Jam Site near the Lake District in some kind of Georgian mansion, which had a games room with both a normal-sized, and a giant-sized Jenga set. Using these as inspiration, along with other objects such as moss and mushrooms, we created tiny worlds for the clay character to move through.
<br><br>
In the game you talk to other clay creatures and solve riddles to mend their broken objects.
