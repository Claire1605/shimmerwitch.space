<p>Claire is a self-taught programmer, artist and game designer. She works freelance as well as on her own personal projects, and has a number of creative interests including pixel art, claymation, programming and developing in Unity.
<br><br>
She is particularly interested in games that promote exploration, personal and diverse narratives, and non-violence. She is also a big fan of small tools such as <a href="https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy" target="_blank">Bitsy</a>, and their accessible nature.
She has run several events and game jams (such as <a href="http://fusejam.games/" target="_blank">Fuse Jam</a>), which aim to provide open creative spaces for people to play and collaborate.
<br><br>
Claire is currently working on Before I Forget with <a href="https://www.3foldgames.uk/" target="_blank">3-Fold Games</a>, which is currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1126600/Before_I_Forget" target="_blank">wishlist on Steam</a>.
