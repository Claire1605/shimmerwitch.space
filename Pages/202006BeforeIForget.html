Before I Forget is a short first-person narrative exploration about Sunita, a woman suffering with dementia. Within the game, the player acts as Sunita, walking through her house and interacting with objects. These interactions reveal Sunita's thoughts and memories, as well as her feelings and interpretation of the situation she is in.

It is currently available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1126600/Before_I_Forget" target="_blank">on Steam</a> and <a href="https://3foldgames.itch.io/before-i-forget" target="_blank">on Itch.io</a>.
<br><br>
The game is designed by myself and Chella Ramanan (<a href="https://www.3foldgames.uk/" target="_blank">3-Fold Games</a>), and we have been working with a team of collaborators to bring the project to life.
<br><br>
Alongside game design, my contribution to the development of the project has been the programming, 3D art and textures, visual effects and level design. The link between visual design, level design and player experience has been something that I have been extremely interested in, and have enjoyed experimenting with to create parallels in the visuals and gameplay to the game's narrative.
<br>
One of the earliest blog posts I wrote covered my early experiments with the <a href="../Blog/bifShader.html" target="_blank">colour-spreading effect</a> that features prominantly in Before I Forget. 
<br><br>
The game was conceived at the XX+ Game Jam in Bristol, October 2016. It was here that I met Chella, and within our team we made a prototype of Before I Forget over the course of the game jam weekend. The prototype was met with praise from the other jam attendees and won the 'audience choice award' for game that they would most like to see developed further. Due to this we continued development during weekends and evenings over the following 2 years until I was able to move from employment to freelance work, allowing me to spend more time on development of the game during 2019 and 2020.
