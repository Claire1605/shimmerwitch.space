<h2>Playtesting and Iteration</h2>
<br>
In <a class="fullMoonBlogLink" href="http://www.shimmerwitch.space/AsterismBlog/FullMoonBlog03.html">June's blog post</a> I talked about prototyping the space between the songs and how I had struggled to figure this section out. 
I ended the blog by saying this:

</a>
<h2>Playtesting</h2>
<br>
It's been in the back of my mind since then, and after I did a small playtest of the game with a couple of people I realised that my previous design for this section wasn't working in the way I had expected. 
Currently I have gameplay drafts for two thirds of the songs, which is enough to test the general pacing and tone of the game from start to end. 
The playtest session was the first time I'd seen anyone play the game in full so it was a great opportunity to evaluate the overall design so far. 
What I realised was that the 'space between' felt very unconnected to the rest of the game. 
It was too long, which disrupted the pacing of the game. It was very unclear who the player character is and if they are the same person in and between songs. 
There was no sense of progress and the narrative of a journey outwards into space didn't come across as the transitions between scenes were jarring. 
It would also have led to a lot of extra work for me with the amount of narrative and audio content, that if anything I think would have detracted from the overall experience. 
<br><br>
I'm glad that I was able to see this in action before I continued any further along that path, but it was hard to evaluate until this point - without seeing it in the context of the full game. 
From the prototype I had made so far and the playtesting session I was able to go through another round of iteration to refine the design further. 
<br><br>

<h2>Iteration</h2>
<br>
After the playtesting I went through several steps to get to the version I'm at right now. 
<br><br>
STEP 1: Brainstorm potential solutions. 
<br>


<br><br>
STEP 2: Narrow down ideas. 
<br>

<br><br>
STEP 3: Create a paper prototype. 
<br>

<br><br>
STEP 4: Create a digital prototype. 
<br>

<br><br>
STEP 5: Self-evaluate and iterate - repeat steps 3 and 4. 
<br>

<br><br>
STEP 6: Playtest new prototype. 
<br>

Something I've been learning through this project is the importance of prototyping ideas, and also that different types of ideas/design need diff
