<h2>Progress update!</h2>
<br>
It's been a little while since my last blog as I've had a couple of months of either being away from home or at home being ill, but I wanted to share how Asterism is going and also share some exciting news!
<br><br>
<h2>Where is the development at?</h2>
<br><br>
In the last blog I talked about my music production process. The music of Asterism (all 12 tracks!) is now mostly done, and just needs a little tweaking and then mastering. 
It's been a really great experience learning to record and mix music, and I'm happy with how its turned out!
<br><br>
I was also working on a demo version of the game to take to events, which has three complete playable levels ('Sun', 'Hemisphere', and 'Contours'), and now I'm working through the remaining levels to update the placeholder mechanics and art I had in there for testing. 
As of yesterday I just have 5 more levels to go with an ambitious goal to get these done by the end of September, so I'll let you know how that goes next time!
<br><br>
<h2>Games events and playtesting</h2>
<br><br>
With my demo complete, I was ready to start taking Asterism to games events to see people playing it in the wild (and catch any bugs I'd missed!). 
So far I've been to PLAY Expo Glasgow, and Nottingham Video Games Expo with the demo and have had a really great reaction from people! 
It's been lovely to watch people play Asterism and chat with them afterwards - I had so many great recommendations and suggestions from the events for things to research or ideas for the game.

I've been applying to a few other events and am very excited today to announce that I'll also be taking the demo of Asterism to <a class="fullMoonBlogLink" target="_blank" href="https://adventurexpo.org/">AdventureX</a> in November! 
If you're not familiar with AdventureX, it's a games expo at the University of Greenwich, London, dedicated to narrative games. 
I'm very excited as it's a really lovely event that I've not been to since 2017 when we showed our 3-Fold Games game 'Before I Forget'.  
<br><br>
That's all for now! Next time I'll try to do another art update and go into depth about a little more of my process :)
