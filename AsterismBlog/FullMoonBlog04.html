<h2>Production and Project Organisation</h2>
<br>
I'm now three months into this project and I've been thinking a lot about production over the last couple of weeks. 
This is partly because I've now had some amount of time to evaluate if the various production timelines and methods I planned in at the start of the project are working for me. 
It's also come up in conversations I've had with a few people I am currently mentoring about their own projects, as well as with my production mentor for Asterism, so I've been in an interesting position of both giving and receiving advice on the subject alongside trying to take a step back and look at my own process. 
Lastly, I've experienced myself over-scoping projects or taking inefficient development routes enough to know that it's very stressful and I want to avoid those mistakes in future. 
<br><br>
This is the first of my own projects that I've actively thought about production in this way, though I've been involved in a number of projects during freelance work and employed work that had a dedicated producer or a solid production plan. 
It's been interesting seeing different approaches, and has given me a good sense of which methods I respond to best. 
So below I'll be sharing the approach that I'm taking, and why. I might also do a future blog post at the end of the project to compare my experience then to now. Maybe I'll find that none of these methods work the way I expected them to, only time and admin will tell!
<br><br>
<h2>Initial Decisions</h2>
<br>
At the start of this project there were three process goals I set out for myself, which were:
<br><br>
1. Make the development process a positive experience.
<br>
2. Avoid scope-creep.
<br>
3. Work with a production mentor.
<br><br>
These goals were mainly driven by previous experiences, both positive and negative. I thought about other projects I'd been involved in - what kept me motivated, happy and on track, and what I would like to have changed to make development smoother. 
<br><br>


<h2>1. Make the Development Process a Positive Experience</h2>
With Asterism, I had a couple of years of vaguely thinking about the project from time to time, writing some music, and doing a couple of mechanics experiments before I decided to take a more structured approach to it. 
All I really knew at that point was that I wanted to make an 'interactive music album' that explored some personal topics in a space-themed environment. 
I had a Google Jamboard that I put some initial ideas down on, including how the songs on the album might map over to planets in the solar system: 
<br><br>
<a href="AsterismBlog\Images\01_Jamboard.PNG">
<img src="AsterismBlog\Images\01_Jamboard.PNG"/ alt="[Google Jamboard screenshot of song titles represented by planets]">
</a>
<br><br>
The blue wavy line represents something like emotional intensity, or maybe happiness / sadness. I also had some mood boards for the songs / planets which helped me to think about the tone. 
What was important for me here is that I was able to map out the extent of the game very visually (which blends into goal number 2) and keep the space theme at the forefront of my thoughts. 
I started using Miro some time after this and decided to make my notes on there space-themed too. 
Doing this made everything much more enjoyable to look at that a document or spreadsheet, but also helped me stay more in the headspace of the theme of the game, and take a more playful approach even when planning the project or organising tasks.
<br><br>

</a>
<br><br>
On this section of the Miro board "Asterism: planning" is a star, orbited by five planets - "Game", "Music", "Narrative", "Process", and "Funding". 
Each planet has lots of satellites which go into more detail about questions I want to answer in order to define what the game is, the development process, how to approach funding etc. 
<br><br>
If I zoom into the 'Process' section on that Miro screenshot, you can see the questions I asked myself at the start of the project when I was thinking about this first goal. 
<br><br>
<a href="AsterismBlog\Images\04_MiroProcess.jpg">
<img src="AsterismBlog\Images\04_MiroProcess.jpg"/ alt="[Miro board close-up of questions about process]">
</a>
<br><br>
'Process' has three concentric orbits around it containing satellite questions. 
The broadest questions are in the closest orbit, and the outer orbits contain off-shoots of these or more specific questions. 
So there's questions like "What do I want to feel during the experience", which leads out to "How will I acheive this?", and also "Keep the end goal in mind. What is the end goal (of the project)", which I felt were important to define. 
If I zoom further into this one in particular, you'll see I'm not really talking about the end goal of the game, but more the general experience I personally want from the development.

<br><br>
Something else I wanted to make more enjoyable, and effective, was my approach to bug-fixing. 
I have a tendency to get frustrated easily with debugging, and can rush without working through the problem logically, which ends up taking longer. 
I can also find it difficult to work through bugs on my own. 
A friend at university who studied Computer Science told me about a method called <a class="fullMoonBlogLink"  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging</a>, which uses the idea that when explaining a problem to someone else you are forced to work through it logically in order to communicate it and are therefore likely to identify a solution in the process. 
This method always stuck with me, and wanted to recreate it in recently a way that gave me a structure to follow whenever I felt stuck. 
When I came across this incredible notebook, I decided that instead of a rubber duck I would have a pink fluffy unicorn cat to assist me. 
<br><br>
<a href="AsterismBlog\Images\04_DebugNotebook.png">
<img src="AsterismBlog\Images\04_DebugNotebook.png"/ alt="[Pink fluffy unicorn cat notebook]">
</a>
<br><br>
On the first page I wrote down a series of questions that would guide me through articulating and identifying the problem, and a second set of instructions for working through solutions. 
On the next page you can see my first attempt at using this system. It worked really well and made the whole process a *lot* less stressful! 
However, for some reason I did it once and then put the notebook away for two years until the other day when it came up in conversation. 
Why did I stop using this method that worked so well for me? Who knows. Brains are complex. 
The important thing is that I picked it up again the other day and the method still worked, so I'm going to try very hard to keep using it!

</a>
<br><br>
I try to make other aspects of digital organisation playful too - here are some cases I made for my two backup hard drives and the project hard drive I use for Asterism. 
I feel like if something is fun to look at or to use then I'm going to enjoy doing it more. If I enjoy it then I'll look forward to it and am more likely to do it regularly. 
Backing up files feels like a nicer task when I get to look at these silly monster faces.

<br><br>
<h2>2. Avoid Scope-Creep</h2>
In any game development that doesn't have a very rigid specification to begin with, new features will be added as the development progresses. 
In my experience, scope-creep tends to happen if these features are more ambitious than the time, money or skill resources of the developer allows. 
It can also happen when you get new ideas you are excited about and start implementing them before you've finished designing other parts of the game. 
<br><br>
As an example, the first game I made by myself was a text-based adventure game with monster mechanics heavily inspired by Pokémon. 
I began by writing a lore extending back thousands of years, and progressed by designing multiple evolution, type-advantage, battle, side-quest, main-quest, and narrative systems. 
I finished 18 months later with 'chapter 1' published to my itch page and decided never to return to it. 
You can watch me nervously talking about this while endless pages of my project notes scroll behind me here around 1 minute in:
<br><br>

<br><br>
In the talk I gave at A MAZE I used it as an example of how 'small tools' such as <a class="fullMoonBlogLink"  target="_blank" href="https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy">Bitsy</a> helped me learn to scope better. 
I also think that even when using larger tools, such as Unity, there are similar approaches that can help with scope management, they're just not in-built into the tool itself. 
Setting yourself constraints about what the game actually is and being realistic about your resources can save you a lot of stress later down the line. 
If you haven't made many games before it can be difficult to estimate how long development will take you, so in general I would always hugely overestimate. 
Also, the more games you make the easier it becomes to estimate how long making games will take you, so aiming to make lots of small games has a two-fold positive effect on scope management! 
<br><br>


<br><br>
-avoid scope-creep (greyboxing method, vs mechanic polish - whatever the need is for your game to test it asap, do that. plan the whole game roughly, drwa/write an outlien, chapter headings whatever for the whole game (it can change later that;s ok, it's more about putting boudnaries in place for yourself so you know your limits), trello board month by month rather than doing/done etc. makes it easier to see tasks over the whole project timeline and not keep pushing things back forever. standup meetings, blog posts etc. miro is great...



<br><br>
<h2>3. Work with a Production Mentor</h2>
-get prodction consultaiton (mal, we meet every 3 months and chat about how everything is going + at the beginning of the project to set things up, the 3 month thing gives me motivation to ensure i'm organised and )
