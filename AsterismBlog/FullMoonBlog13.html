<h2>First Trailer!</h2>
<br>
A little update to officially announce my Steam & Itch pages for Asterism, as well as to show you the teaser trailer I made!
<br><br>
I've not made a trailer before, but it was pretty fun! I used the free version Microsoft ClipChamp, which got recommended to me when I tried to open the default Windows Video Editor that I normally use to cut bits of video together. 
It's definitely the best free video editor that I've used, and I'll probably use it again for future videos and trailers. 
<br>
It was interesting thinking about what parts of the game to actually show of, and how to overlay audio - since it's a music video game! 
Should I just use one track and try to sync the gameplay up, or clips from several tracks so that it's more like an album preview? 
The teaser trailer is for the 3-track demo of the game and I only wanted the trailer to be around 60 seconds, which doesn't leave much time per track. 
In the end I did a bit of a combined approach, using synced gameplay from the very start of the game in Sun, and then an abrupt jump into an edited version of Hemisphere to showcase some nice visuals from all 3 tracks. 
This matches the pacing of the actual game quite well too, and gives me a bit of space (pun intended) at the start for some intro text. 
<br><br>

<h2>Show me the trailer already!</h2>
<br>
Yeah I probably should have put this section first. Ok, here it is!

Thank you! :)

<h2>Some other thoughts...</h2>
<br>
Hmm, now I'm wondering... considering the whole development process of Asterism is kind of a series of curated interactive videos, is there a way I could make my next trailer interactive too? 
If you're reading this and have thoughts on this I would love to hear them, and I'll keep mulling it over myself too!
